				<h3>FAQ</h3>
				<div class="faq-item">
					<h4>When will I get my username?</h4>
					<p>There is no official timeline. This is to only provide a overview of what is going on currently.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="faq-item">
					<h4>I was apart of the "rollout", but I don't have the change yet!</h4>
					<p>There are some bugs where it does not show up initally. You can try logging out, force closing, and pulling back up the Discord client. If does not still work, you may need to wait some time as the rollout seems to not be all at once when the rollout happens.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="faq-item">
					<h4>How do I submit that I got the change but the status here is different?</h4>
					<p>You can reach out to me via Discord at @<a href="https://discord.com/users/222073294419918848">thecodingguy</a>.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="faq-item">
					<h4>There are users who have it way after the date you list!</h4>
					<p>It was most likely with a previous rollout, which rolled the new system out for Discord Staff, Partners, Verified Server Owners, and some server owners with a certain threshold revenue.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="faq-item">
					<h4>How do I learn more about this change?</h4>
					<p><a href="https://dis.gd/usernames">https://dis.gd/usernames</a></p>
				</div>
				<div class="faq-item">
					<h4>How often does this page update?</h4>
					<p>It updates when more information is available, so it may not be right away, too! The page will automatically refresh every 5 minutes.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="faq-item">
					<h4>What are the times?!</h4>
					<p>The times displayed are in YOUR local time. However, you may hover over the time you see and get its UNIX timestamp.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="faq-item">
					<h4>Is this official?</h4>
					<p>Short answer: No. Long answer: No, this is just data collected by the community and I just made a website for everyone to see and stay informed.</p>
