					<h4>What does the "up to (month)" mean?</h4>
					<p style="font-size: 90%;">This means up to the end of that month.<br>For example, if the wave stopped for Non-Nitro users at March 2019, then that means everyone in that category should have it up to the end of that month.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="faq-item">
					<h4>How do I learn more about this change / is there another way of tracking?</h4>
					<p style="font-size: 90%;">To learn more, you can visit the official Discord support page: <a href="https://dis.gd/usernames">https://dis.gd/usernames</a>.<br>I also suggest checking out <a href="https://arewepomeloyet.com">hampuskraft's tracker</a> where you can view anonymized user-submitted data to get an overview of where it's heading next! (Also, there's a neat graph too!)</p>
				</div>
				<div class="faq-item">
					<h4>How often did the data / page update?</h4>
					<p style="font-size: 90%;">About every 5 minutes. You could also manually trigger a refresh, which would reset the 5 minute counter. The data may have been initially out of date as we used multiple reports as evidence, to avoid misinformation.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="faq-item">
					<h4>What are the times?!</h4>
					<p style="font-size: 90%;">To help you understand where the tracker is, 99% of this page is in your local timezone.<br>To convert it or use it elsewhere, click on the time that appears in your time. You may select the text in the tooltip or double-click it to copy the UNIX timestamp to the clipboard.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="faq-item">
					<h4>Is this official / What's your source?</h4>
					<p style="font-size: 90%;">Sadly, <b>this is unofficial</b>. Note that the sources vary, but sources are mainly from Discord Admins, which is an official Discord server.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="faq-item">
					<h4>I want to report an issue / report a update / use the API / talk to you / etc...</h4>
					<p style="font-size: 90%;"><b>NOTE: Please do not ask me when you will get the username or any estimate of such. <i>I don't know.</i></b><br>You can reach out to me via Discord at @<a href="https://discord.com/users/222073294419918848">thecodingguy</a>.<br>As far as the API goes: as of October 7th, 2023, the API has been shut down.</p>
